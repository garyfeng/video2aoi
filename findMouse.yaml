# format:

# aoi: followed by 4 integers, separated by spaces or commmas, 
#       in the order of x1, y1, x2, y2, of the box to be ocr-ed
#       or x, y, w, h, depending on the study-wide defintion of "aoiFormat"
#       don't use () or [], etc.

# ocr: followed by 4 integers, separated by spaces or commmas, 
#       in the order of x1, y1, x2, y2, of the box to be ocr-ed
#       or x, y, w, h, depending on the study-wide defintion of "aoiFormat"
#       don't use () or [], etc.

# break: specify this if you don't want to continue processing 
#       the rest of **sibling** items 
#       following the **successful** processing of the current entry
#       doesn't matter if you specify True or False, so long as it appears

# match: always followed by a image filename, followed by options:
#       match: filename.png, 0.2, where 0.2 is the threshold for successful matching (normalized sqdiff)
#       sourceLoc: x, y, w, h, or x1, y1, x2, y2, depending on "aoiFormat" 
#           this specifies the subimage that will be used as the signature. 
#           and by default, match will first tries to do a image match at this location in the dest image
#           if this fails, it will do an exhaustive template matching
#       unmatchLog: string to log in the case of unmatch; use this carefully
#       currently we do a template match. 
#       @@ we should consider a feature-based or a color-histgram method, 
#       which may be faster and allow for Bayesian decisions on best matches
